# Next.js Boilerplate
### Overview
Starter project based on Next.js. It contains folder structure, code formatter and style linter. I made it for my own use but you can clone this project and use it to create your own Next.js project. Supports TypeScript.

### Installation & Setting up Firebase
Clone this repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dtsiki/nextjs-boilerplate.git
$ cd nextjs-boilerplate
```

Install project dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

In the project directory run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your browser.

If you are more of a fan of Yarn, you can use the following command instead:

```sh
yarn i
yarn start
```

Hope you like it! ðŸ’œ
